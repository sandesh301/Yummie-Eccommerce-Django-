# Yummie-Eccommerce-Django-
Project Overview:

This project is a hands-on exploration of building an e-commerce website, taking inspiration from the renowned 'Nurture Life' platform. The technology stack used here involves React.js for the frontend and Django for the backend. It represents a comprehensive e-commerce solution, from product listings to secure payment processing.

Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed with a focus on providing an engaging and intuitive shopping experience. React.js components ensure responsiveness and interactivity, making it a pleasure for users to explore products.

Robust Backend: Django's capabilities shine in the backend, where models for products, users, orders, and more are meticulously structured. User authentication and data security are paramount.

API Integration: A seamless connection between the React frontend and Django backend is established, enabling core features like adding products to the cart, order processing, and user profile management.


How to Run:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up the Django backend and the React.js frontend in their respective directories.
Configure the API endpoints in the React.js code to connect to the Django backend.
Run both the frontend and backend to start the application.
