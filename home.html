You’ll find a variety of deliciously balanced kid favorites, including Mac & Cheese with Hidden Butternut Squash and Chicken Meatballs with Spiral Pasta & Veggies. Many of these options smoothly blend veggies right into the sauce so your kid won’t even notice the veggies are there!</p>

Our menu features meals that can help expose picky eaters to new colors, textures and tastes. We recommend gradually incorporating meals from outside of our Picky Eater Favorites to familiarize your child with a wider variety of flavors. Remember that it can take 9–15 tries for kids to accept a new food, so stick with it! You’re doing the right thing, and patience does pay off.</p>

                                                <p>To find the best food for your picky eater, use the filters on our menu and look for the Picky Eater Fav banner. You’ll find a variety of deliciously balanced kid favorites, including Mac & Cheese with Hidden Butternut Squash and Chicken Meatballs with Spiral Pasta & Veggies. Many of these options smoothly blend veggies right into the sauce so your kid won’t even notice the veggies are there!</p>
                                                <p>Yummie Nepal is also here to help your picky eater become not-so picky! Our menu features meals that can help expose picky eaters to new colors, textures and tastes. We recommend gradually incorporating meals from outside of our Picky Eater Favorites to familiarize your child with a wider variety of flavors. Remember that it can take 9–15 tries for kids to accept a new food, so stick with it! You’re doing the right thing, and patience does pay off.</p>
                                                <p>Whether you order our kids meal delivery or not, we also offer a ton of picky eater resources for you to draw from.
